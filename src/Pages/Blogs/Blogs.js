                    <p>React state management is a process for managing the data that React components need in order to render themselves. This data is typically stored in the component's state object. When the state object changes, the component will re-render itself. React state management is basically half of a React app.</p>

                <div className="collapse-content">
                    <p>The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object. Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an object, we use Object.getPrototypeOf and Object.setPrototypeOf. Nowadays, in modern language, it is being set using __proto__.</p>

                </div>
                <div className="collapse-content">
                    <p>The main objective of unit testing is to isolate written code to test and determine if it works as intended. Unit testing is an important step in the development process, because if done correctly, it can help detect early flaws in code which may be more difficult to find in later testing stages. <br /><br />
                        They enable you to catch bugs early in the development process. Automated unit tests help a great deal with regression testing. They detect code smells in your codebase. For example, if you're having a hard time writing unit tests for a piece of code, it might be a sign that your function is too complex.</p>

                    # React vs. Angular vs. Vue?

                    <p><b>Angular:</b> <br />
                        Angular.js is an MVC framework. A major disadvantage of Angular is that it uses a regular DOM, and thus, the entire tree structure of the HTML tags is updated, which massively impacts the loading time. Angular.js has its Ionic framework for mobile applications. <br /><br />

                        <b> React:</b> <br />
                        One of the biggest of them is that React.js uses a virtual DOM that only compares the previous HTML code differences and only loads the different parts. This significantly impacts the loading times. In a positive way, of course. <br /><br />
                        <b> Vue:</b> <br />
                        Vue is built from the bottom up to be progressively adaptable, unlike other monolithic frameworks. The core library focuses solely on the view layer, and it’s simple to use and connect with other libraries or applications. This framework’s fast learning angle is almost a trademark. It’s a flexible framework that may be used as a library or a full-fledged framework for developing large web applications. <br /><br /></p>
